                        </h2>
                        <p class="lead">In our dataset, there is information on neighborhood, neighborhood group, room type, minimum number of days, and more that correlate with each other in intriguing ways. Our goal is to predict the price of an Airbnb listing in New York City, which will be measured in US dollars. </p>

                        </h2> <p class="lead"> Currently, it is very popular to place a property on the Airbnb market to make some extra cash and even have a career if one owns a very nice property. Given this trend, we were inspired to create a machine learning model that can help potential hosts and tourists alike. It can help potential hosts decide whether it would be profitable to place their property on the market given its location, room type, and more. As for the tourists, they can use our model to verify that the renting price is reasonable. Another final justification was that this was a viable data set, large enough for us to ensure reasonably accurate results, but not so large that our computers could still handle it without crashing.</p>

                        <p class="lead">One correlation we have found is that the number of reviews decreases with the increase in minimum nights. This shows that the longer the required minimum nights in an Airbnb, the fewer reviews it will recieve. Most people want to rent an Airbnb with lots of reviews to ensure the quality of the house and it is a good insight to know that a lower number of reviews is acceptable if the minimum number of nights is higher.</p>

                        <p class="lead"> A violin plot is used to visualize the distribution of data. The width of it relates to the frequency of data points in that region. For example, Manhattan (red) has a very narrow violin shape, indicating that there are not many listings with the price of the median ($141). </p><br>
                        <p class="lead"> Manhattan (red) had the highest median price ($141) and its $45-141 range had the most distributed values. Brooklyn (blue) had the second highest median price ($90) and the most distributed values were in the range of $25-90, the widest of all the boroughs. Staten Island (purple) and Queens (green) had the same median price ($75) and same range for the most distributed values ($48-75) but differed slightly in its maximum prices. Lastly, the Bronx (orange) had the lowest median price ($65) and most of its distributed values were in the range of $40-65. </p>

There was a slightly positive correlation between reviews per month and number of reviews.</p>

                        <p class="lead">First, we tried a baseline linear regression model. This model basically uses a line to predict the price of the Airbnb. Linear regression assumes that all features have a linear relation with price of an Airbnb in New York City, so we can fit a line of best fit to predict future values. After testing the model with our dataset, we got a root mean square error of 74 which isn't great as most of our values got to around 40 and the higher the RMSE is, the worse it is. However, it's still not terrible.</p>

The KNN machine learning algorithm looks at data points in the testing set and predicts a price based on its similarity to other data points in the testing set. The model creates groups of similar data points and matches the input variables to one of those groups. Our model created thousands of groups out of our 43,000 data points and has an RMSE value of 43.212.</p>

                        <p class="lead">PCA is used to combat the issues of high-dimensional data by way of dimensionality reduction. We reduced the number of colums we had while keeping 98.22% of the varience by using Principal Component Analysis. Essentially PCA helps to find patterns in the high-dimensional datasets. We made a 3D graph to show the reduced 3 columns in 3 principle components. We would be able to use the new data in a new model to see if the accuracy increased or decreased.

                        <p class="lead">So what is the significance of our project? Because we know which features are most correlated with price, we can identify both the factors that lead to a higher priced Airbnb and also predict what it would cost to stay in an Airbnb in New York. </p>
